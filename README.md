# MedScribeAI

Sovereign, offline-first AI-assisted patient case-taking and clinical documentation platform.

MedScribeAI is an offline-first, AI-assisted patient case-taking and clinical documentation platform designed for low-connectivity healthcare environments, rural primary health centres (PHCs), and high-volume outpatient clinics.

**Project Purpose:** Sovereign clinical documentation copilot eliminating typing bottlenecks in high-volume public OPDs.
**SIH Problem Statement Alignment:** SIH26047 — Patient Case-Taking Software (Theme: MedTech / BioTech / HealthTech | Team: AstraX).
**Authoritative Current Status:** *SIH 2026 demo-ready with declared limitations. Core offline-first workflow validated; clinical deployment requires further real-world validation.*
**Important Limitations:** Assistive documentation only; does not perform autonomous diagnosis or unprompted prescription generation. Acoustic ASR accuracy and live ABDM production certification pending real-world field trials. Full technical validation is documented in [docs/VALIDATION.md](docs/VALIDATION.md).

## 1. Problem Statement & Background

In high-volume public health clinics across India and low-resource global environments, healthcare providers face severe administrative bottlenecks:

- **EHR Documentation Burden:** Clinicians routinely spend between 40% and 50% of their consultation time typing clinical records, significantly reducing time available for direct patient care (Sinsky et al., 2016).
- **Intermittent Connectivity:** Over 35% of rural primary health posts experience recurrent broadband outages, making cloud-only electronic medical record (EMR) systems unusable during clinic hours.
- **Language & Literacy Barriers:** Patients present speaking diverse regional languages and colloquial dialects (such as Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, and Hinglish), while standard EHR interfaces require typed English.
- **Clinical AI Safety Concerns:** Generic large language models frequently hallucinate non-existent diagnoses, invent normal physical findings, or fail to capture explicit patient negations, creating unacceptable risks in clinical workflows.

MedScribeAI specifically addresses **Smart India Hackathon (SIH 2026) Problem Statement SIH26047 — Patient Case-Taking Software**.

---

## 2. Solution Overview

MedScribeAI provides an integrated, edge-native clinical workstation and patient-facing self-service intake terminal:

1. **Multilingual Ingestion:** Ingests patient voice utterances, touch-based selections, and historical paper documents in regional Indian languages.
2. **Local AI Inference:** Runs embedded quantized speech recognition and deterministic clinical NLP on the local workstation CPU without mandatory internet connectivity.
3. **Canonical Fact Extraction:** Normalizes conversational inputs into structured `ClinicalFact` entities with explicit assertion, temporality, and experiencer attributes.
4. **Verbatim Evidence Anchoring:** Maps 100% of extracted facts to exact substring quotes from the patient's own words.
5. **Deterministic Safety Gating:** Triggers real-time emergency triage alerts for acute red-flag symptoms and detects drug-drug and allergy conflicts.
6. **Human-in-the-Loop Governance:** Enforces a strict physician review and approval workflow before any prescription slip can be printed or exported.
7. **Standards Interoperability:** Exports validated HL7 FHIR R4 Bundles ready for Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) integration.

---

## 3. What MedScribeAI Does NOT Do

To maintain safety and regulatory integrity, MedScribeAI enforces strict clinical boundaries:

- **It does NOT autonomously diagnose diseases:** MedScribeAI is a case-taking and documentation assistant. It structures clinical data for human clinician review.
- **It does NOT generate unprompted medical decisions or prescriptions:** Prescriptions require explicit human physician entry and approval.
- **It does NOT invent missing facts:** If a symptom, vital sign, or review-of-systems category is not mentioned, it remains unasserted (`NOT_ELICITED`). The system never defaults missing history to "No Known Allergies" or "Normal".
- **It does NOT silently fall back to cloud services:** In sovereign mode, if a local component is unavailable, the application displays a transparent warning; it never silently transmits patient data to third-party servers.

---

## 4. Core Principles

- **Offline-first:** The primary clinical workflow operates with zero internet access in physical airplane mode.
- **Evidence-grounded:** Every clinical claim anchors to verbatim source evidence (100% evidence grounding).
- **Physician-controlled:** AI output is classified as `AI_DRAFT` until reviewed, modified, and signed by a licensed clinician.
- **Consent-aware:** Patient consent is captured per purpose (case-taking, document digitization, hospital sharing). Withholding sharing consent hard-blocks outbound synchronization.
- **Multilingual:** Supports clinical terminology and regional idioms across Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil, English, and Hinglish.
- **Interoperability-ready:** Built on the HL7 FHIR R4 clinical data standard and ABDM integration foundations.

## 6. System Architecture

MedScribeAI employs a decoupled desktop architecture: a native **Tauri v2** desktop shell (written in Rust) hosting a **React 19** frontend, communicating over local loopback with an embedded **Python FastAPI** clinical sidecar process.

## 7. Canonical Data Flow

1. **Ingestion:** Patient speaks into the microphone or selects options on the kiosk. Audio is captured as 16 kHz 16-bit mono PCM.
2. **Speech Recognition:** The local ONNX ASR engine transcribes audio into raw text tokens.
3. **Language Identification:** The language identification module classifies the utterance script and dialect (ISO-639-1).
4. **Fact Extraction:** The clinical NLP engine maps tokens to standardized medical concepts.
5. **Evidence Grounding:** The evidence gate verifies that every extracted fact matches an exact substring in the source transcript.
6. **Attribute Tagging:** The engine classifies assertion (`present` or `negated`), temporality (`current` or `historical`), and experiencer (`patient` or `family`).
7. **Safety Evaluation:** The deterministic safety engine audits extracted facts for red flags and contraindications in < 0.01 ms.
8. **Draft Assembly:** A structured SOAP note draft is saved to local SQLite in state `AI_DRAFT`.
9. **Clinician Review:** The physician reviews the note, inspects evidence tooltips, and makes any necessary in-place edits.
10. **Approval & Sign-Off:** The physician approves the encounter. The status transitions to `APPROVED`.
11. **Interoperable Export:** The physician exports a validated FHIR R4 Bundle or prints a prescription slip.

---

## 8. Clinical Governance & State Machine

Clinical documentation follows an immutable, state-enforced lifecycle:

```
[AI_DRAFT]
    │
    ▼  Physician opens encounter in review panel
[REVIEWING]
    │
    ▼  Physician verifies facts and clicks "Approve Documentation"
[APPROVED]
    │
    ├─► Material Edit Detected ──► Reverts to [REVIEWING] (Invalidates Prior Approval)
    │
    ▼  Clinician initiates export
[EXPORTED]
```

- **Prescription Gate:** Printing is physically disabled while an encounter is in `AI_DRAFT` or `REVIEWING`.
- **Export Gate:** FHIR serialization requires `state == 'APPROVED'`.
- **Edit Invalidation:** Any subsequent modification to approved clinical facts automatically reverts the encounter to `REVIEWING`, ensuring unapproved edits are never exported.

---

## 9. Consent Model

Patient autonomy is preserved through an explicit, granular consent framework:

1. **Consultation Consent:** Grants permission to record symptoms and perform case-taking. Required to initiate an intake session.
2. **Document Digitization Consent:** Authorizes scanning and entity extraction from historical medical records.
3. **Hospital Sharing Consent:** Authorizes outbound transmission to external electronic health records or ABDM registries.
   - *Revocation Invariant:* If hospital sharing consent is absent or revoked, the system permanently blocks network synchronization, retaining the record strictly within local SQLite storage.

## 17. Declared Limitations

In adherence to healthcare software engineering standards, MedScribeAI transparently declares its current boundaries:

1. **Acoustic ASR Evaluation:** The INT8 ONNX speech engine is runtime-verified with sub-100ms inference; however, acoustic accuracy (WER/CER) across diverse rural dialects has not yet been benchmarked against a live multi-speaker audio corpus.
2. **Host OCR Dependency:** The host evaluation machine does not have the Tesseract OCR binary pre-installed. The document upload pipeline cleanly reports `is_available: false` and prompts for manual clinical entry rather than fabricating text.
3. **ABDM Sandbox State:** ABHA 14-digit format and Luhn checksum validation execute locally; live ABDM OTP verification operates against simulated sandbox endpoints pending official NHA production credentials.
4. **Non-Diagnostic Scope:** MedScribeAI is a clinical documentation assistant. It does not perform autonomous diagnosis or replace clinician judgment.

---

## 18. Product Roadmap

- **Phase 9.0:** Pre-bundle portable Tesseract binaries and traineddata models within the desktop distribution.
- **Phase 9.1:** Execute formal multi-accent acoustic speech benchmarking against the AI4Bharat Kathbath dataset.
- **Phase 9.2:** Onboard production NHA ABDM Milestone M1, M2, and M3 gateway connectors.
- **Phase 9.3:** Multi-center clinical usability and time-motion study in rural district health centres.
