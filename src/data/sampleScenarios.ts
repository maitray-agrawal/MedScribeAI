    transcript: `Doctor: Good morning Kwame, come in and sit down. What brings you to the clinic today?
Patient: Morning doctor. I've been feeling very unwell for the past 3 days. I started having intense chills and shivering on Tuesday evening, followed by high fever and severe headache.
Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any other symptoms? Nausea, vomiting, joint body aches, or abdominal pain?
Patient: Yes, my whole body aches, especially my joints and back. I felt nauseous yesterday and vomited once after breakfast. I couldn't eat much today.
Doctor: Any cough, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or neck stiffness?
Patient: No cough or chest pain. My neck is fine, just a very heavy headache behind my eyes.
Doctor: Okay. Have you been sleeping under an insecticide-treated bed net consistently?
Patient: Mostly yes, but I traveled to my family's farm last week and forgot my net for two nights.
Doctor: Alright. Let's do a physical examination. I will check your vitals first. Temperature is 38.9°C, blood pressure is 118/76 mmHg, heart rate is 104 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 18, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.
Doctor: On examination, eyes show mild conjunctival pallor, no jaundice. Chest is clear on auscultation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, but I can feel mild splenomegaly about 2cm below the left costal margin. No neck stiffness or rash.
Doctor: We will do a Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test (mRDT) and a hemoglobin check right away.
Patient: Doctor, the nurse took the finger prick blood test earlier.
Doctor: Perfect. Let me read the result: mRDT is positive for Plasmodium falciparum. Hemoglobin level is 10.2 g/dL, which indicates mild anemia.
Doctor: So you have uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. We will start you on Artemether-Lumefantrine (Coartem) 80/480mg, taken twice daily for 3 days. Take each dose with a fatty meal or milk so it absorbs properly. I'll also give you Paracetamol 1000mg three times a day for fever and body aches. Drink plenty of clean ORS or boiled water.
Patient: Thank you doctor. Should I come back?
Doctor: Yes, if your fever doesn't come down after 48 hours, or if you start vomiting repeatedly, feel unusually weak, or pass dark urine, come back immediately. Otherwise, review in 1 week if not fully recovered.`

    transcript: `Doctor: Hello Maria, good to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last visit two months ago?
Patient: Good morning Doctor. Overall I feel okay, but I've been having mild morning headaches at the back of my head for the past two weeks, and sometimes my feet feel a little swollen in the evening.
Doctor: Thanks for letting me know. Are you taking your medications regularly every day?
Patient: To be honest doctor, I ran out of Amlodipine about 3 weeks ago because I couldn't make the trip to the central pharmacy, so I've only been taking the Metformin. Also, my knees were hurting so I took Ibuprofen almost daily last week.
Doctor: I understand. Taking NSAIDs like Ibuprofen daily can raise your blood pressure and strain your kidneys, so we need to be careful with that. Let's check your vitals now.
Doctor: Blood pressure is elevated today at 158/96 mmHg. Heart rate is 78 bpm. Weight is 74 kg.
Doctor: Physical exam shows mild +1 bilateral pedal edema up to the ankles. Heart sounds S1 and S2 present, no murmurs. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Fasting capillary blood glucose taken by nurse this morning was 8.6 mmol/L (155 mg/dL).
Doctor: Urine dipstick shows negative for protein and glucose today.
Doctor: Maria, your blood pressure is high today because you ran out of Amlodipine and took frequent Ibuprofen. We need to resume your blood pressure medicine immediately. We will increase Amlodipine to 10mg once daily to better control your BP. We'll continue Metformin 500mg twice daily with meals.
Doctor: For knee pain, please stop daily Ibuprofen. Use Paracetamol 500mg as needed instead, and try warm compresses. I will also refer you to our community health worker to help arrange local pharmacy refill delivery so you don't run out.
Patient: That would be so helpful doctor. When should I check my blood pressure again?
Doctor: Please visit the clinic nurse next week for a quick BP check, and see me in 4 weeks for repeat blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, and renal function test.`

Doctor: Liam has Acute Right Otitis Media (middle ear infection) along with a viral upper respiratory infection.
Doctor: Because of his age, fever, and bulging ear drum, we will prescribe Amoxicillin oral suspension 400mg/5ml, 5ml (400mg) twice daily for 7 days. Give him Paracetamol syrup 250mg/5ml, 5ml every 6 hours as needed for pain and fever. Keep him well hydrated with water and soups.

    transcript: `Doctor: Good morning Amina. Welcome to your 24-week antenatal checkup. How are you feeling, and are you feeling good baby movements?
Patient: Morning doctor. Yes, the baby is kicking very actively, especially in the evening! But I feel a bit more tired than usual in the afternoon.
Doctor: That's great about the baby movements. Any headache, vision changes, abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, or fluid leaking?
Patient: No headache, no bleeding, no fluid leaking.
Doctor: Excellent. Let's check your vitals and examination.
Doctor: Blood pressure is 112/70 mmHg, pulse is 76 bpm, weight is 62 kg (gained 2 kg over last 4 weeks).
Doctor: Examination: Mild conjunctival paleness. Fundal height corresponds to 24 weeks gestation. Fetal heart rate is 142 beats per minute, regular rhythm using Doppler. No pedal edema. Urine dipstick: Protein negative, Glucose negative.
Doctor: Let's review your second trimester lab panel: Hemoglobin is 10.1 g/dL (mild anemia of pregnancy). Blood group O positive, Syphilis (VDRL) non-reactive, HIV rapid screening negative, Blood sugar 1-hour post 50g glucose loading is 6.2 mmol/L (normal, rules out gestational diabetes).
Doctor: Amina, baby is growing well and your blood pressure is normal. You have mild gestational iron-deficiency anemia, which is very common around 24 weeks. We will add Ferrous Sulfate 200mg (60mg elemental iron) taken once daily with orange juice or water on an empty stomach. Continue your Folic acid and prenatal vitamin.
Doctor: Also eat iron-rich foods like dark leafy greens, beans, and lean meats. Avoid drinking tea or coffee directly with your iron tablet because it reduces iron absorption.
Patient: Thank you doctor! When is my next visit?
Doctor: Return in 4 weeks at 28 weeks for your routine checkup, Tetanus toxoid booster, and repeat Hb check.`

    transcript: `Doctor: Hello Rajesh. What brings you to the clinic today?
Patient: Doctor, I started having frequent loose watery stools yesterday midnight. I've been to the toilet about 6 times since morning. I also have abdominal cramping and mild nausea.
Doctor: Any blood or mucus in the stool? High fever or severe vomiting?
Patient: No blood, just clear watery stool. I vomited once yesterday night after dinner, but today I've been able to sip some tea without vomiting. No high fever.
Doctor: Did you eat anything unusual recently?
Patient: I ate spicy street food from a roadside stall yesterday afternoon.
Doctor: I see. Let's do an examination. Vitals: Blood pressure 110/72 mmHg, Heart rate 92 bpm, Temperature 37.4°C, Respiratory rate 16, O2 sat 99%.
Doctor: Physical exam: Mucous membranes are slightly dry, skin turgor is normal with immediate recoil. Abdomen is soft, hyperactive bowel sounds in all four quadrants, mild diffuse tenderness on palpation, no localized guarding or rebound tenderness.
Doctor: You have acute non-cholera, non-dysenteric gastroenteritis with mild dehydration, likely foodborne.
Doctor: Treatment plan: Antibiotics are NOT indicated right now as there is no bloody stool or systemic fever. The main treatment is oral rehydration. I am giving you Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) packets — dissolve 1 packet in exactly 1 liter of clean water and drink 1 glass after every loose stool. Also start Zinc Sulfate 20mg once daily for 10 days to aid mucosal recovery.
Doctor: Continue eating light meals like rice, bananas, porridge. Avoid fatty foods or dairy for 2 days.
Patient: Do I need any antibiotics or anti-diarrhea pills?
Doctor: No anti-motility pills like Loperamide, as we want your body to naturally flush out the toxin. If stool becomes bloody, or if you develop high fever, intractable vomiting, or dizziness, return immediately.`
